# Is Covid Near Me?
## A Web Application 

## Description:
"Is Covid Near Me?" is a simple web app people can use to find out, well, if covid is near them!

The goal of this project is to keep simplicity and usability in mind to allow almost anyone to use the tool and get the information they need served to them as quickly and easy to understand as possible. 

## Notes:
While currently text based, this project has a few long term goals that could improve the quality of the experience, such as...
- Map Selection (Click on your state and county rather than a drop down menu!)
- Automatic Location detection
- Vaccine Data
- Percentages, such as % with covid, as well as % increase & decrease from previous weeks

And more! Feel free to contact anyone on our team if you have any questions or would like to learn more.
